= MarkdownFu

"Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows 
you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then 
convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)."

Markdown was created by [John Gruber][1]

MarkdownFu is a Rails (ActiveRecord) plugin which will convert attributes from 
Markdown into html and store the result in the <tt>[attribute_name]_html</tt> attribute. 
You will need to define such attribute in your migrations for each markdown 
enabled attribute in your models.

You may define multiple markdown attributes per model and they will be inherited
to subclasses using Single Table Inheritance.

== Example

    class Page < ActiveRecord::Base

      # stores the html version of content into content_html
      markdown :content

      # stores html version of markdown_body into converted_body
      markdown :markdown_body, :converted_body

    end
